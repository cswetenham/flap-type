# FLAP-TYPE TODO

- One enemy sprite moving + respawning
-- fixed X vel and random Y vel, Y pos depending on Y vel so it mostly goes
   through middle of screen?
- Detect collision with enemy sprite
- Detect pass enemy sprite safely
- Count and render 'best score'
- Wave of enemy sprites moving
- Draw background of some kind (have stars?)
- Render background
- Scroll background
- Pipes/background - how does RType do it? How to test BG collision with only
  certain background? (not stars)
- Sound on collision
- Sound on fall
- Music

Maybe:
- Use vertical 8x16 sprites? Is that for the whole game/frame/per sprite?
