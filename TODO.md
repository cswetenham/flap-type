# FLAP-TYPE TODO

- Doesn't render correctly in other emulators! (NEStopia for example)
- Fix enemy y values, spread is wrong and some out of bounds
- Render score > 9
- Wave of 4 enemy sprites moving together (delayed from each other by N frames)
- Draw background of some kind (have stars?)
- Render background
- Scroll background
- Pipes/background - how does RType do it? How to test BG collision with only
  certain background? (not stars)
- Sound on collision
- Sound on fall
- Music

Maybe:
- Use vertical 8x16 sprites? Is that for the whole game/frame/per sprite?
